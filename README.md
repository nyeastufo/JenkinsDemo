# JenkinsDemo

This is a simple Jenkins Demo for Windows 10, we used to use Redhat linux to host the Jenkins, and I like to try it on Windows system.

1. build the first simple HelloWorld.java, it display the time stamp

2. create the Jenkins job, HelloWorldBuild

3. test it, one hint, you have to make sure that the javac version and java version is consistant, otherwise, it will failed to run

4. build second Jenkins job, HelloWorldRun

5. build third Jenkins job, HellowWorldMessage

6. create job chain to build the first chained job list
